This is a second attempt of the week 9 assignment.

When this was done previously, I had no internet, couldn't commit anything and couldn't import new packages. I have since, after the final week, had a weekend with internet to update, refamiliarse myself and push it forward.

This builds on the Week8 project and I think this shows a marketable improvement to my knowledge back then vs now. I have experiemented more with Tailwind and started to really enjoy CSS. I understand radix packages and want to impliment them further. I feel comfortable understanding file layouts with nextjs and also using react components in them, When learning react seperately I found something didn't click before that does now and I can see while new, a lot of companies are slowly moving to nextjs. 

In terms of Clerk Authentication, it was nice to go back and do it again with the packages, it helped me understand it a lot more other than just copying the code and not being able to test if it worked. I one thing I still haven't managed to do is fully understand user profiles, how to let people make comments and also attach posts to user id. As well as actually making a create profile page to have users enter data to create a profile This is something I will further explore as this is a project I will be continuing. I have a few ideas about how to even make this somewhat marketable and a useful tool for Yu-Gi-Oh Players. 

I am overall happy with how this has turned out. But considering the issues with internet prior and the little time I had with internet, I can see this project not getting as high marks as I may could of reached, however it will be a good stepping stool for me to continue
